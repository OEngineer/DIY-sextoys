## Saw/Drill Remote using bicycle brake cable and lever
This simple laser-cut remote works on my Milwaukee 18V drill and reciprocating saw.
I've included the Fusion 360 model and a PDF for cutting the pieces (assuming 6mm thick acrylic).
I used a 2.5mm screw, locknut and washers to join the two pieces, and a hitch pin to connect the bicycle cable part to the rest.
Look at the photos.
